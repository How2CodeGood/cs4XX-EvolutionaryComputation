Evolutionary Art

Overview
========

Evolutionary art is a branch of Generated art (art created by an autonomous system) in which alterations are made to initial piece over many iterations. With this you can create artificially generated visual randomness, stylized recreations of existing images, and infinitely changing/evolving images.

* `Evolutionary Art can be carried out in a variety of ways  <https://franciscouzo.github.io/>`_
    #. Building something out of nothing (Maze Generator, Fractals, Chaotic Map)
    #. Manipulating and producing new art based on an existing initial input (Genetic Art, Ishihara Plate Generator)
    #. Continually changing in response to feedback from user (Random Art)

It’s important to separate Evolutionary Art for Biological Art, which uses organic living material as opposed to, paint, metal, wood and computer code.

Variations From other GAs
=========================

Art is a much more subjective medium than strictly logistical problems, therefore, evaluating fitness is executed differently than in most other GAs.

* Many Evolutionary Art GAs have strict process rules between generations, if A occurs, than do B.
    #. An example of this is found in `Conway’s Game of Life <https://electricsheep.org/>`_, where the number of living neighbors determine whether a cell will be alive of dead next gereration.


* Other programs implement user input to assist with fitness evaluation, where users are prompted to choose one or more of their favourite models.
    #. `Electric Sheep <https://electricsheep.org/>`_ is a modern implementation of evolutionary art that allows users to contribute and influence selection on a massive population.
    #. Sheep with the most votes will be selected for breeding and mutation into tomorrow's population pool

    The UI allows for users to vote for or against individuals in the population, collectively contributing to their fitness like a hive mind.

Evolutionary Music
==================
A subsection of evolutionary art, a population is initialized with the ability to create some audio.

Affect of our Lives
===================

As improvements to evolutionary art continue to be made, it’s prevalence in our day to day life with increase.

* Corporations can save big on budgets by employing software instead of a real commissioned artist
* Animators can start outsourcing their more tedious work to a computer
* Producers and composers can be simulated through an application

Production among these occupations could skyrocket past human capabilities putting those who choose to not employ the help of computers at an unfair disadvantage.
